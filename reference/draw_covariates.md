## Details

the cov_list is a list object of vectors with a vector for each
covariate to be added, either numeric or categorical the first value in
each vector should be either "numeric" or "categorical"

for numeric variables, the second value should specify whether it is
drawn from a normal or uniform distribution using "normal" or "uniform"
the next two values are the mean and sd if drawn from a normal
distribution or min and max if drawn from a uniform distribution

for categorical variables, the remaining values in the vector will be
probabilities for each level of the variable, which will be labeled as
a, b, c, and so on

example: cov_list \<- list( c("numeric", "normal", 40, 4),
c("categorical", 0.3, 0.4, 0.3), c("categorical", 0.5, 0.2, 0.3),
c("categorical", 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2), c("numeric", "uniform", 1,
10))
