## Arguments

- visible_data:

  Data frame, data including the left and right bound of the MICs (use
  import_mics_with_metadata to format correctly) and any covariates
  (including the non-linear term)

- model:

  String, "pspline" or "polynomial". Which non-linear term should be
  used in model

- mu_formula:

  A formula for a survreg object from the survival package, left side of
  equation should be a surv object using "interval2" format, right side
  should be the non-linear term (polynomial or pspline) and any
  covariates. Can be a single formula or a list of formulas where length
  is equal to the number of components where the trend in the mean is
  being estimated.

- pi_formula:

  Formula, for the component weight model. Model is fit using mgcv's gam
  function. Nonlinear terms include s() and lo(). Basis of s() function
  can be changed using bs argument to s(). Use c == "2" for the left
  side of the formula.

- max_it:

  Numeric, maximum number of iterations for the EM algorithm for any
  given model fitting.

- ncomp:

  Numeric, number of components to be fitted. When fitting a reduced
  model where one component is not estimated, that component should
  still contribute to the value in ncomp. E.g. a reduced model where the
  upper component is fixed and mu for the lower component is being
  estimated has a value of ncomp = 2.

- tol_ll:

  Numeric, maximum tolerance for change in likelihood between steps of
  the algorithm for model convergence to be achieved.

- browse_at_end:

  For internal model testing

- browse_each_step:

  For internal model testing

- plot_visuals:

  For internal model testing

- prior_step_plot:

  For internal model testing

- pause_on_likelihood_drop:

  For internal model testing

- pi_link:

  String: "logit" or "identity", link function for the generalized
  linear model fit for the pi model (component weights).

- verbose:

  Numeric, controls amount of information printed during model fitting

- model_coefficient_tolerance:

  Numeric, maximum tolerance for change in model coefficients (insluding
  spline terms) between steps of the algorithm for model convergence to
  be achieved.

- maxiter_survreg:

  Maximum iterations used in survreg model fitting, default is 30.

- initial_weighting:

  Numeric, if 1: initial observation weights are estimated using linear
  regression at the highest and lowest tested concentrations. If 2, used
  a randomized start suitable for simulation studies on model validity
  but otherwise not recommended. If 3 or greater, fits a linear models
  to the components and estimates intial weights based on this model
  fit.

- sd_initial:

  Numeric, value greater than 0 and less than 1. Proportion of the range
  from the highest concentration to lowest concentration that is used as
  the initial estimate of sigma for the estimated components. Default is
  0.2

- stop_on_likelihood_drop:

  For internal model testing

- n_models:

  Currently deprecated, will be used in future versions as part of model
  validation

- seed:

  Currently deprecated, will be used in future versions as part of model
  validation

- randomize:

  Currently deprecated, will be used in future versions as part of model
  validation

- non_linear_term:

  String, non-linear term to be included in the model. Variable in the
  pspline term in the pspline model or in the polynomial term in the
  polynomial model.

- covariates:

  String, covariates to be included in mu model aside from the
  non-linear term.
